# Basic Rules

## (Classic Gamemode)

All Players begin with 500,000 Cash.

An event will begin before Year 1, 4 and 7, for a chance to earn Hint Points.

[!ref Hint Points](/mechanics/hint-points)

After the Year begins, You can purchase items from the Stock Market.

The Basic Command in Stock Siege works as following:

Buy/Sell [Quantity] [Item Name]


Please note that You may only buy a maximum of 9,999,999 Stocks per item!


There are three basic methods of purchase:

- Stating exact number of items you want to purchase
- Splitting into ratios (In this case, Cash divided by Total Ratio Number)
- Going All-in on certain item(s) (Not recommended unless certain)


The Standard Deadline of purchase is 48 hours (a.k.a. 2 Days). However, they can be extended or shortened.

Keep in mind that Remaining in debt after Year’s End results in empty inventory without warning!


When the Stock Market has been closed, New Price will be revealed, and Results for individual inventories will be revealed, along with Leaderboard.

All Purchased Items will NOT be kept, and will be erased after results are revealed.

The Cycle starts over again, and at the end of Year 9, Whoever has the most cash wins the season.
Cash is then converted to Season Points. The Formula goes with the Logarithmical Method of Calculation (Base 2).
