# Basic Rules
(Classic Gamemode)

## Beginning

All Players begin with 500,000 Cash.

An event will begin before Year 1, 4 and 7, for a chance to earn Hint Points.

After the Year begins, You can purchase items from the Stock Market.


## Purchasing stocks

The Basic Command in Stock Siege works as following:

Buy/Sell [Quantity] [Item Name]

There are three basic methods of purchase:

###

Stating exact number of items you want to purchase
:   Buy 100 A Cherry

Splitting into ratios (In this case, Cash divided by Total Ratio Number)
:   Buy half A Cherry and half B Gold

Going All-in on certain item(s) (Not recommended unless certain)
:   Buy A Cherry

###

!!!danger Maximum stock limit
Please note that You may only buy a maximum of 9,999,999 Stocks per item!
!!!

!!!danger Going into debt
If you attempt to buy more stocks than you can with your balance, you will go into debt, which means your stock purchases will fail and you will need to fix your purchases.
Keep in mind that Remaining in debt after Yearâ€™s End results in empty inventory without warning!
!!!

The Standard Deadline of purchase is 48 hours (a.k.a. 2 Days). However, this can be extended or shortened.

When the Stock Market has been closed, New Price will be revealed, and Results for individual inventories will be revealed, along with Leaderboard.

All Purchased Items will NOT be kept, and will be erased after results are revealed.

The Cycle starts over again, and at the end of Year 9, Whoever has the most cash wins the season.
Cash is then converted to Season Points. The Formula goes with the Logarithmical Method of Calculation (Base 2).
