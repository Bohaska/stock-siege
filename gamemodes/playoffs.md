# Playoffs

*With Fan Glenn creating a new experimental FPS Playoffs Season, This is no longer under Fan Glenn Credit - It’s now by LunarisK.*

FPS Playoffs Gamemode has 20 years of purchase, divided into Five parts as follows:
- Y1 ~ Y9: Regular Season (Y1 Event)
- Y10 ~ Y14 - Round of 12 (Y10 Event)
- Y15 ~ Y19: Round of 8 (Y15 Event)
- Y20: Championship 4

**Each Part (Except Final Part) starts off with an Event**. Hint Points Reward works the same way as the Standard Reward System. Note that **Round of 8’s event is restricted to FPS Camp Events**!

Before Purchase begins, Every Player receives 1 Hint Point every year. As well as this, 1 Playoff Point will be awarded to two people in Two Rounds of Tatsu Bot Randomizing.

The Purchase goes as usual; However, Stage 3 will be given to the Highest Percentage Increase, and they will get 5 P/O Points. Does not apply to Year 20, which is the Final Year / Championship 4.

After the Regular Season ends, the Top 10 with the most cash earns P/O Points.

In addition, If you are below Cutoff Point by the end of each round, You will be eliminated and have your inventory frozen. **Eliminated Players cannot purchase items, use Hint Points in any way, or participate in events.** Each Survivors’ Playoff Points are equivalent to 2% Extra Cash along with Next Round’s Starting Cash. Keep in mind that Stock Prices & Odds will not reset.
