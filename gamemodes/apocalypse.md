# Apocalypse

*Gamemode Concept by JWKH.*

Apocalypse Gamemode starts players off with 1 Billion (1,000,000,000) Cash & 3 Hint Points from beginning.

Stock Market starts 100x the Regular Price of stocks. Your job is to survive 9 years while having your Unspent Cash BURNED after every Purchase Years. Stocks only lose in price, they never gain in price. 

Hint Points also work differently here. Instead of the odds representing the chance that the price of the stock increases, it represents the chance that the price of the stock will have a low change in price. The odds system goes as:

Price change | Chance of getting a low change in price
--- | ---
Low -0% | -20% 
Low -5% | -15% 
Low -10% | -12% 
Low -15% | -9% 
Medium -20% | -6% 
Medium -25% | -3% 
Medium -30% | 0%
Medium -40% | +3% 
Medium -50% | +6% 
High -60% | +9% 
High -70% | +12% 
High -75% | +15% 
High -80% | +20% 

Hint System also works differently:

Level 1: Chance of Low Fall revealed.

Level 2: Strength of the Fall revealed.

Level 3: Gives exact Fall amount.

Even still, Events will still occur with the Standard Reward system.

Hint Points usage is the same as that of Classic Season, along with ability to donate hint points. However, Eliminated Players will be forbidden to use their hint points in general.

Whoever survives with the highest cash remaining wins the game.
