# Odds Calculation

How do you calculate the odds of an item increasing or decreasing in price for every item? It’s simple.

Every item starts with a 50% Increase Chance at the beginning.

Increase and Decrease affects next year’s Odds, based on this chart:

---    | ---
(P/O) -90% | +30
(P/O) -85% | +25
-80% | +20
-75% | +18
-70% | +15
-60% | +12
-50% | +10
-45% | +9
-40% | +8
-35% | +7
-30% | +6
-25% | +5
-20% | +4
-15% | +3
-10% | +2
-5% | +1
0% | 0
5% / 10% | -1
15% / 20% | -2
25% / 30% | -3
40% | -4
50% | -5
60% | -6
70% | -7
80% | -8
90% | -9
100% | -10
150% | -12
200% | -15
300% | -18
400% | -20
(P/O) 500% | -25
(P/O) 900% | -30

All Odds begin at 50% Increase Odds, and as stated in this picture, are determined as if that value is chosen (left), Specific amount of changes occur to that stock’s odds (right).

For example, If a Cherry Stock got a +90% Increase, The odds will decrease by -9. If it gets -60% Decrease, It increases by +12, and so on.
